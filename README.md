| 0   | Runtime Lip Sync from SoundWave (must contain PCM audio)             |

## 2.3 Understand the Demo Level

Open `BP_GeppettoExampleActor > Event Graph` to start exploring how the
Geppetto plugin works.

![Where to find the GeppettoExampleActor in the Outlier](./docs/images/Understand_the_demo_level_image_1.png)

![Click on the EventGraph tu unfold all the available graphs](./docs/images/Understand_the_demo_level_image_2.png)

You‚Äôll see a block for each key event and `BeginPlay`.

![Example of BeginPlay block](./docs/images/Understand_the_demo_level_image_3.png)

![Screen of the various Blueprint nodes available in this example actor](./docs/images/Understand_the_demo_level_image_4.png)

### 2.3.1 Components Required

Every actor using the plugin must have these 4 components:

- ‚úÖ A Skeletal Mesh with Morph Targets
- üîä An Audio or MediaSound Component
- üß† A [Geppetto Player Component](#44-geppetto-player-component) (e.g., DemoPlayer)
- üì° A [Geppetto SoundWave Player](#42-geppetto-soundwave-player)

![Components you should have](./docs/images/Components_image_1.png)

The Audio/MediaSound Component and the Geppetto SoundWave/URL Player used will depend if the plugin is used with pre-generated or runtime assets. You can use both methods on the same character.

### 2.3.2 Begin Play

In the BeginPlay Event, all Geppetto components are initialized. You can find more information about component initialization below:

- `Geppetto SoundWave Player Initialize`
- `Geppetto URL Player Initialize`
- `Geppetto Player Initialize`

![Path to the GeppettoExampleScene in Unreal](./docs/images/Begin_Play_image_1.png)

The Geppetto Player initialize node uses a Phoneme, Emotion and Micro Expression table as parameters to animate the character. You can create your own table in order to animate characters with custom Morph Targets. 

Please read section [4.5](#45-geppetto-phoneme-data-table), [4.6](#46-geppetto-emotion-data-table) and [4.7](#47-geppetto-micro-expressions-data-table) for more details.


### 2.3.3. Phonemes / Lipsync

The **keyboard 1 and 2** events are related to pre-generated phonemes.


- Please read section [3.1.1 - Pre-Generated Phonemes generation](#311-pre-generate-phonemes-as-a-geppetto-data-asset) of the documentation for more information on how to pre-generate phonemes in a Data Asset using the Geppetto Editor Interface.

- Please read section [3.1.2 - Play animation with SoundWave](#312-play-a-geppetto-data-asset-with-soundwave) of the documentation for more information on how to play the Geppetto phonemes from a Data Asset

- Please read section [4.10.1 - Geppetto Data Asset](#4101-geppetto-data-asset) of the documentation for more information about the Geppetto Data Asset structure

![](./docs/images/Phonemes___Lipsync_image_1.png)

The **keyboard 9 and 0 events** are related to runtime phonemes.

- Please read section [3.2 - Runtime Phoneme Generation](#32-runtime-phonemes-generation-and-animation-blueprint) of the documentation for more information on how to generate and play runtime generated phonemes.
- Please read section [4.9.1 - Generate phonemes (using SoundWave)](#492-generate-phonemes-using-soundwave) for more
information on how to generate phoneme from a local audio file (SoundWave, PCM or file)

![](./docs/images/Phonemes___Lipsync_image_2.png)


The plugin uses a [Geppetto Phoneme Data Table](#45-geppetto-phoneme-data-table) to know all Morph Targets values for each phoneme. If the skeletal mesh of your characters have different Morph Targets, it is required to create a new [Geppetto Phoneme Data Table](#45-geppetto-phoneme-data-table) with the Morph Targets used in your characters.     
**Please note that Data Tables for Metahuman are included in this plugin !**   
The Data Table used by the plugin is passed through the [Geppetto Player Component Initialize](#442-initialize) or [Set Phoneme Table](#445-set-phoneme-table) node. Please read section [4.5 - Geppetto Phoneme Data table](#45-geppetto-phoneme-data-table) of the documentation for more information about phoneme Data Table.

### 2.3.4. Emotions

The **keyboard 3 and 4 events** are related to emotions.

- Please read section [3.3 - Change Emotions](#33-change-emotions) for more information on how to change emotions in Blueprints.
- Please read section [3.5 - Emotion Tag System](#35-emotion-tag-system) for more information on how to change emotions with tags.
- Please read section [4.12.2 - Geppetto Emotion](#4122-geppetto-emotion) of the documentation for more information about the Geppetto emotion structure.
- Please read section [4.4.7 - Set Emotion Custom Curve](#448-set-emotion-custom-curve) of the documentation for more information about the emotion custom transition curves.

![](./docs/images/Emotions_image_1.png)

The same way as phonemes, emotions use a [Geppetto Emotion Data Table](#46-geppetto-emotion-data-table) to determine the Morph Target values for each emotion. Please read section [4.6 - Geppetto Emotion Data Table](#46-geppetto-emotion-data-table) of the documentation for more information.

### 2.3.5. Micro Expressions

The **keyboard 5, 6, 7 and 8 events** are related to micro expressions.

- Please read section [3.4 - Play or Loop Micro Expressions](#34-play-or-loop-micro-expressions) of the documentation for more information on how to use micro expressions.
- Please read section [4.4.9 - Play Micro Expression](#4410-play-micro-expression) of the documentation for more information about the node.
- Please read section [4.4.11 - Start Micro Expression Loop](#4411-start-micro-expression-loop) and [Stop 4.4.12 - Stop Micro Expression Loop](#4412-stop-micro-expression-loop) of the documentation for more information about the nodes.

![](./docs/images/Micro_Expressions_image_1.png)

Like phonemes and emotions, micro expressions use a [Geppetto Micro Expressions Data Table](#47-geppetto-micro-expressions-data-table) to retrieve the Morph Targets values.   
This time, however, the values can be **static** (like phonemes or emotions Morph Targets values) or **dynamic** (the Morph Targets values will change each time the Micro Expression is played).    
Please read section [4.7 - Geppetto Micro Expressions Data Table](#47-geppetto-micro-expressions-data-table) of the documentation for more information.

### 3.1.2 Play a Geppetto Data Asset with SoundWave

To play the generated lip-sync and sound :

1. Create a Blueprint class. **If you use Metahuman, you
can use the generated Blueprint class instead** (i.e: *BP_Ada* for the Metahuman named Ada).

![](./docs/images/Play_a_Geppetto_Data_Asset_with_SoundWave_image_1.png)

2. Add the following components :
   - Skeletal Mesh Component
   - Audio Component
   - [Geppetto SoundWave Player](#42-geppetto-soundwave-player)
   - [Geppetto Player Component](#44-geppetto-player-component) (or custom version for Metahuman*)

*If your Skeleton doesn‚Äôt use the traditional node ‚ÄúSet Morph Target‚Äù to update Morph Target values, like Metahuman characters, you need to override some functions from the Geppetto Player Component, otherwise animation will not work.    
Please read section [4.4.1 - Component Inheritance](#441-component-inheritance) for more information.*

![](./docs/images/Play_a_Geppetto_Data_Asset_with_SoundWave_image_2.png)
![](./docs/images/Play_a_Geppetto_Data_Asset_with_SoundWave_image_3.png)

3. Use `BeginPlay` to initialize with:
   - `Geppetto SoundWave Player Initialize`
   - `Geppetto Player Component Initialize`

   ![](./docs/images/Play_a_Geppetto_Data_Asset_with_SoundWave_image_4.png)

4. Use `Play Data Asset` to start playback.
5. Use `Play` node (advanced) if you want to override audio or delay.

You can use the node *Play Data Asset* from the [Geppetto SoundWave Player](#42-geppetto-soundwave-player) whenever you want in your game in order to play the lip sync animation. 
In the example below, the lip sync starts when the user presses the ‚Äòs‚Äô key (do not forget to enable input on this actor if you plan to do the same). 
*You must provide the Data Asset that you want to play*

  ![](./docs/images/Play_a_Geppetto_Data_Asset_with_SoundWave_image_5.png)

If you want to [Apply Delay](#495-apply-delay-phonemes) to the phonemes or emotions before playing the animation, please use the Geppetto SoundWave Player Play node instead. This node can also be used to change the audio SoundWave played with the Geppetto animation (*not recommended*) :

  ![](./docs/images/Play_a_Geppetto_Data_Asset_with_SoundWave_image_6.png)

---

### 3.1.3 Play a Geppetto Sequence

Same idea as before, but with the **[Geppetto Sequencer Component](#45-geppetto-sequencer-component)** and the generated **[Geppetto Sequence](#4102-geppetto-sequence)** :

1. Create a Blueprint class. **If you use Metahuman, you
can use the generated Blueprint class instead** (i.e: *BP_Ada* for the Metahuman named Ada).

![](./docs/images/Play_a_Geppetto_Sequence_image_1.png)

2. Add the following components :
   - Skeletal Mesh Component
   - [Geppetto Sequencer Component](#45-geppetto-sequencer-component)

*If your Skeleton doesn‚Äôt use the traditional node ‚ÄúSet Morph Target‚Äù to update Morph Target values, like Metahuman characters, you need to override some functions from the Geppetto Player Component, otherwise animation will not work.    
Please read section [4.4.1 - Component Inheritance](#441-component-inheritance) for more information.*

![](./docs/images/Play_a_Geppetto_Sequence_image_2.png)
![](./docs/images/Play_a_Geppetto_Sequence_image_3.png)

3. Use `BeginPlay` to initialize the [Geppetto Sequencer Component](#45-geppetto-sequencer-component) with `Initialize`.

   ![](./docs/images/Play_a_Geppetto_Sequence_image_4.png)

5. Use `Play` node to start the lip-sync animation. **You must provide the [Geppetto Sequence](#4102-geppetto-sequence) that you want to play.**

  ![](./docs/images/Play_a_Geppetto_Sequence_image_5.png)

## 3.2 Runtime Phonemes Generation and Animation (Blueprint)

This setup is used for audio generated during gameplay, such as:
- üé§ Player microphone input
- üß† [Ariel TTS plugin](#https://www.fab.com/listings/7a3354f0-44c7-43ea-8656-23814c9f393d)

### Components

1. Skeletal Mesh Component (with Morph Targets)
2. [Geppetto SoundWave Player](#42-geppetto-soundwave-player)
3. Audio Component
4. [Geppetto Player Component](#44-geppetto-player-component) (or custom one for Metahuman)


If you want to have audio spatialization, check the ‚ÄúAllow Spatialization‚Äù box and set a sound attenuation in the Audio Component (you can create a new one if needed) :

![](./docs/images/Runtime_Phonemes_generation_and_animation__Blueprint__image_4.png)
![](./docs/images/Runtime_Phonemes_generation_and_animation__Blueprint__image_5.png)

### Initialization

Use `BeginPlay` to call:
- `SoundWave Player Initialize`
- `Geppetto Player Component Initialize`

![](./docs/images/Runtime_Phonemes_generation_and_animation__Blueprint__image_6.png)

### Phoneme Generation

Whenever you want in your blueprint, i.e: right after the audio file has been generated, call one of the `Generate Phonemes` nodes.    
Trigger one of the following nodes during gameplay:
- `Generate Phonemes (SoundWave)`
- `Generate Phonemes (PCM bytes)`
- `Generate Phonemes (multipart/form-data)`

![](./docs/images/Runtime_Phonemes_generation_and_animation__Blueprint__image_9.png)
![](./docs/images/Runtime_Phonemes_generation_and_animation__Blueprint__image_10.png)

Please note that **it could take up to 15 seconds to generate the phonemes, depending on your audio size and length !**    
For a small file and short sentence (10s or less, <100Kb), the generation should take less than a second.

Once the API returns phonemes and emotions:
- Use `Play` on the corresponding Player
- Optionally apply delay


‚Üí If you use our Ariel plugin to generate the audio files at runtime, please see this example.

## 3.3 Change Emotions

The Geppetto plugin also allows you to animate emotion to your character. All emotions must have been defined in the [Emotion Data Table](#46-geppetto-emotion-data-table) used by the [Geppetto Player](#44-geppetto-player-component).   
Please read section [4.6 - Geppetto Emotion Data Table](#46-geppetto-emotion-data-table) for more details about how to create emotion Data Tables.   
**If you use Metahuman characters, you can use the existing Data Table named ‚ÄúMH_Emotions‚Äù.**

Emotions can be changed when a sentence is pronounced by using tags. Please read section [3.5 - Emotion Tag System](#35-emotion-tag-system) for more information on how to use tags.    
You can also use the Geppetto Player node `Change Emotion` to change your character emotion at any time you want.

## 3.4 Play or Loop Micro Expressions

All micro-expressions must have been defined in the Micro Expressions Data Table used by the Geppetto Player. For more information about this, please read section [4.7 - Geppetto Micro Expressions Data Table](#47-geppetto-micro-expressions-data-table) of the documentation.    
**If you use Metahuman characters, you can use the existing Data Table named ‚ÄúMH_Emotions‚Äù.**

Micro-Expressions can be played in two ways : 

- An **unique** micro-expression
- A micro-expression **loop**. 

For example, you can decide to play a unique blink animation or decide to play a blink animation loop. You can use the Geppetto Player nodes [Play Micro Expression](#4410-play-micro-expression) and [Start Micro Expression Loop](#4411-start-micro-expression-loop) to animate micro-expression on your character.

## 5. Resources & General explanations

---

### 5.1. How does the Geppetto model work?

---

#### Text Acquisition

The text can either be provided directly or generated through Speech-to-Text, which also captures onomatopoeia. For the best results, it is recommended to provide a text that explicitly includes onomatopoeia. Emotion tags associated with the text are also extracted.

---

#### Silence Detection

Silences in the audio serve as markers to define the start and end of the text. The automatic detection of silence depends on the type of audio:

- For synthetic voices, -50 dB silence threshold and 200 ms silence time are recommended.  
- For noisier recordings, -40 dB and 300 ms may be more suitable.

These parameters should be adjusted based on the characteristics of the audio recording.

---

#### Text-to-Phoneme Conversion

The text is converted into phonemes using a machine learning model. This model is language-sensitive, and currently, Geppetto supports English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.  
If additional language support is needed, please contact us.

---

#### Alignment with Audio: Two Model Approaches

There are two types of models available:

---

##### Model 0 (Fast)

This is a machine learning model that aligns silences in the audio with punctuation in the text. Using linear interpolation between the segmented text and audio, it predicts the most probable phonemes for each sequence and assigns a corresponding timestamp based on its position in the text. 

- **Advantage**: This method is fast and requires minimal computing power, making it ideal for real-time applications.  
- **Limitation**: Since it relies on a simple mapping strategy, it may not perfectly capture variations in speech rhythm or nuanced pronunciations.

---

##### Model 1 (Accurate)

This model employs deep learning for a more precise alignment:

- The input audio is converted into a spectrogram.  
- Phonemes from Step 3 are aligned with the silences detected in Step 2.  
- The energy patterns of the spectrogram are matched with the corresponding phonemes.

This approach is highly effective when the audio and text are perfectly synchronized. However, if there are discrepancies, the model might skip or replace onomatopoeia.

- **Advantage**: This model provides high accuracy, making it ideal for cases requiring precise phoneme timing.  
- **Limitation**: It is computationally intensive, requiring more processing power than Model 0.

For both models, each phoneme is assigned an amplitude derived from the audio signal.

---

> Both models are available via API, but local deployment is possible for real-time applications. Please contact us for more details.

## 5.1 Amplitude Calculation

The minimum amplitude is set as the lower bound between 0 and 100, based on the detected phoneme amplitude. This ensures that the phoneme remains visible during execution, even when its natural amplitude is very low.

Similarly, the maximum amplitude acts as an upper limit to prevent excessive deformation of blendshapes, maintaining more natural transitions.

The amplitude sinus step defines the incremental step between two consecutive phonemes' amplitudes, preventing abrupt jumps. This value ranges between 0 and 1:

- The closer it is to 1, the more significant the amplitude variations between phonemes can be.
- Lower values ensure smoother transitions, reducing sudden amplitude shifts.

## 6. Adding Emotion Tags

Emotion tags are integrated into the audio at the appropriate timestamps based on their placement within the sentence, ensuring that the speaker‚Äôs tone and emotional expression are accurately reflected.

You can also enable the automatic emotion detection parameter. Using a deep learning model, it predicts the most appropriate emotion based on both the text and the audio.

Disable this option if you prefer maximum control and optimized performance speed.

---

## 7. Output

The final output is a structured list of (phoneme, timestamp, amplitude). This list is returned via API, but the computation can also be performed locally for real-time deployment in player environments. Please contact us for this option.

## Known bugs

**The plugin shows control-related errors**

If some controls used (named like `CTRL_expressions_‚Ä¶`) are missing in the MetaHuman and you have error messages when you try to initialize the Geppetto Player Component, it is probably due to the MetaHuman version.

‚úÖ Make sure that you have downloaded the MetaHuman with the same Unreal Engine version that you are using for your project.

- MetaHumans downloaded with **UE5.0 and 5.1** are compatible with **UE5.0, 5.1 and 5.2**
- MetaHumans downloaded with **UE5.2 and 5.3** are compatible with **UE5.2 and 5.3**

üì∫ If the error remains, please watch this tutorial video and ensure that you have done all the steps correctly.
